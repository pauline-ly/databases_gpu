\section*{Appendix}
We provide additional experiments for evaluating the static scenario performance when varying the filled factor. 
For \formal{insert}, the throughput of all approaches drops for a higher filled factor as it becomes harder to insert when the hash tables are almost filled.
For \formal{find}, all approaches except \linear has constant performance for different filled factor because they all fall into the category of cuckoo hash and has a fixed number of locations for lookups. 
Overall, \voter achieves the second best performance behind \megakv under the static scenario, which is consistent with our discussions in Section~\ref{sec:exp:static}.
