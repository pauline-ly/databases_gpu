\section{conclusion}\label{sec:con}
In this paper, we contribute a number of novel designs for dynamic hash table on GPUs. 
First, we introduced an efficient strategy to resize only one of the subtables at a time. Our theoretical analysis demonstrated the near-optimality of the resizing strategy. Second, we devised a two-layer cuckoo has scheme that ensures a maximum of two lookups for find and deletion operations, while still retaining similar performance for insertions as general cuckoo hash tables. 
Empirically, our proposed design achieves competitive performance against other state-of-the-art static GPU hash table techniques. Our hash table design achieves superior performance while saving up to four times the memory over state-of-the-art approaches against dynamic workloads.
