\section{experimental evaluation}\label{sec:exp}
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments by comparing the proposed hash table design \voter with several state-of-the-art approaches for GPU-based hash tables. 
Section~\ref{sec:exp:setup} introduces the experimental setup. 
Section~\ref{sec:exp:tune} presents the discussion on the sensitivity analysis of \voter.
In Sections~\ref{sec:exp:static} and \ref{sec:exp:dynamic}, we compare all approaches under the static and the dynamic experiments respectively.

\subsection{Experiment Setup}\label{sec:exp:setup}

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Baselines.} We compare \voter with several state-of-the-art hash table implementations on CPUs and GPUs. which are listed as the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \revise{\chash is well-established CPU-based concurrent hash table that parallelizes cuckoo hash \cite{li2014algorithmic}. }
	\item \cudpp is a popular CUDA primitive library which contains the cuckoo hash table implementation published in~\cite{alcantara2009real}.  
	We use the default setup of \cudpp which automatically chooses the number of hash functions based on the data to be inserted.
	\item \revise{\warp is a state-of-the-art warp-centric approach for GPU-based hash table \cite{junger2018warpdrive}. \warp employs a linear probe approach for handling hash collision. }
	\item \megakv is a warp-centric approach for GPU-based key value store published in~\cite{zhang2015mega}. \megakv employs a cuckoo hash with two hash functions and
	it allocates a bucket for each hash value. 
	\item \slab is a state-of-the-art GPU-based dynamic hash table \cite{ashkiani2018dynamic}, which employs chaining and dedicated memory allocator for resizing.
	%\item \google is an efficient CPU-based hash table implementation\footnote{https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash-c11/}. We choose the \emph{dense\_hash\_map} implementation since it provides the best efficiency.
	\item \voter is the approach proposed in this paper. 
\end{itemize}
We adopt the implementations of the compared baselines from their corresponding inventors.
\revise{The codes of \voter are released\footnote{https://github.com/pauline-ly/Dycuckoo.}. For GPU-based solutions, all performance numbers are calculated purely based on the run-time on GPUs. The overhead of data transfer between CPUs and GPUs can be hidden by overlapping the data transfer and GPU computation, as proposed in MegaKV \cite{zhang2015mega}. Since this technique is orthogonal to the approaches proposed in our paper, we thus focus on GPU computation only. 
} 
%For \megakv, we note that its intra-block synchronization could lead to inconsistency issue as well as a large number of insertion failures, especially when the filled factor is high.  
%Thus, we revise its code by replacing the intra-block synchronization with atomicExch to resolve the race condition. The adoption of atomicExch preserves the design principle of \megakv for \emph{not} locking the entire bucket for updates. Moreover, it leads to less insertion failures and similar performance against its original implementation. 

%Note that we do not compare with the dynamic GPU hash approach proposed in \cite{ashkiani2018dynamic} for two major reasons. First, we cannot obtain the original implementation from its authors. Second, the approach devises a dedicated memory allocator other than cudaMalloc. A dedicated allocator will improve the performance but add complexity the system. Additionally, it needs to occupy a large memory in advance and is not transparent to other GPU applications.
%In contrast, our proposed approach only uses native allocator supported. 
%We do not compare with \cite{breslow2016horton} since it only improves \megakv marginally using a more costly insertion process.

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Datasets.} We evaluate all compared approaches using several real world and the summary of the datasets can be found in Table~\ref{table:exp_data_sets}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \dstwitter: Twitter is an online social network where users perform actions include \emph{tweet}, \emph{retweet}, \emph{quote} and \emph{reply}.
	We crawl these actions for one week via Twitter stream API\footnote{https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview} on trending topics US president election, 2016 NBA finals and Euro 2016. The dataset contains 50,876,784 KV pairs.
	\item \dsreddit: Reddit is an online forum where users perform actions include \emph{post} and \emph{comment}. We collect all Reddit \emph{comment} actions in May 2015 from \emph{kaggle}\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com.reddit/reddit-comments-may-2015} and query the Reddit API for the \emph{post} actions the same period. The dataset contains 48,104,875 actions as KV pairs. 
 	\item \dstpch: Lineitem is a synthetic table generated by the TPC-H benchmark\footnote{https://github.com/electrum/tpch-dbgen}. We generate  100,000,000 rows of the lineitem table and combine the \emph{orderkey}, \emph{linenumber} and \emph{partkey} column as keys. 
	\item \dsrandom: Random is a synthetic dataset generated from a normal distribution. We have deduplicated the data and generate 100,000,000 KV pairs.  
	\item \dsali: Databank is a PB-scale data warehouse that stores Alibaba's customer behavioral data for the year 2017. Due to confidentiality, we sample 10,000,000 transactions and the dataset contains 4,583,941 encrypted customer IDs as keys.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Static Hashing Comparison (Section~\ref{sec:exp:static}).}
Under the static setting, we evaluate \formal{insert} and \formal{find} performance among all compared approaches. 
In particular, we insert all KV pairs from the datasets followed by issuing 1 million random search queries.

%\end{figure*}


\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Dynamic Hashing Comparison (Section~\ref{sec:exp:dynamic}).}
Under the dynamic setting, we generate the workloads by batching the hash table operations. 
We partition the datasets into batches of $1$ million insertions. 
For each batch, we augment $1$ million \formal{find} operations and $1 \cdot r$ million \formal{delete} operations,
where $r$ is a parameter to balance insertions and deletions.
After we exhaust all the batches, we rerun these batches by swapping the \formal{insert} and \formal{delete} operations in each batch. 
We evaluate the performance of all compared GPU approaches except \cudpp and \warp as they do not support deletions. 
We exclude the CPU approach as it is significantly slower than the GPU-based approaches. 
Since \megakv does not provide dynamic resizing, we double/half the memory usage followed by rehashing all KV pairs as its resizing strategy, if the corresponding filled factor falls out of the specified range. 
Moreover, if an insertion failure is found for a compared approach, we trigger its resizing strategy.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}\label{sec:exp:tune}

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Vary the number of tables.}
A key parameter that affects the performance of \voter is the number of hash table chosen. For the static scenario, we present the throughput performance of \formal{insert} and \formal{find} for varying number of hash tables in Figure~\ref{fig:vary-table}, while fixing the memory space of the entire structure to ensure the default filled factor $\theta$. 
The throughput of \formal{insert} increases with more hash tables, since there are more alternative locations for relocating a KV pair. 
\revise{The performance slightly degrades with more tables beyond 4. As the total allocated memory is fixed,
the size of each table becomes smaller for more tables. This leads to more evictions for some overly occupied tables and degrades the performance slightly.
Another interesting observation is that we achieve the best performance on the \dsali dataset. This is because \dsali has the least ratio of unique keys (Table~\ref{table:exp_data_sets}). Inserting an existing key is equivalent to an update operation, which results in better performance compared with that when inserting a new key.}
The throughput of \formal{find} remains constant for additional hash tables as the two-layer cuckoo hashing guarantees at most two look ups for \formal{find}. In the remaining part of this section, we fix the number of hash tables to be $4$.

\vspace{1mm}
\noindent\textbf{Resizing analysis.}
To validate the effectiveness of our resizing strategy proposed, we compare it with rehashing. 
For upsizing, we initialize \voter with all the data and the filled factor as the default upper bound $85\%$. Then, we perform one time upsizing, i.e., upsize one subtable, and compare our resizing strategy against rehashing all the entries in the subtable by reinserting the entries with Algorithm~\ref{algo:insert}.
For downsizing, the setup is a mirror image of the upsizing evaluation with an initializing filled factor as the default lower bound $30\%$. 
The throughput is reported in Figure~\ref{fig:resize}. 
The throughput of rehashing for the upsizing scenario is severely limited, since the remaining subtables not being upsized are almost filled and inserting KV pairs resulting frequent evictions.  
In comparison, the downsizing throughput of reinsertion is significantly faster due to a low filled ratio.
Our resizing strategy achieves dramatic speedups over rehashing for downsizing as well. Besides, it only locks the subtable being resized and supports concurrent updates for the remaining subtables.

\subsection{Static Hashing Comparison}\label{sec:exp:static}

\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Throughput Analysis.} In Figure~\ref{fig:static-all}, we present the throughput of all compared approaches over all datasets under the default setting.
\revise{GPU-based approaches outperform the CPU-based baseline significantly. For \formal{insert}, \warp demonstrates the best performance overall. This is because \warp employs the linear probing strategy, which achieves better cache locality than the cuckoo strategy \cite{junger2018warpdrive}. Nevertheless, \voter shows competitive throughput. 
For \formal{find}, \megakv shows the best performance at the default filled factor since it simply checks two buckets for locating a KV pair.
Although \voter also checks two buckets, it has slightly inferior performance than \megakv as \voter employs another layer of hashing that adds cost to the overall performance.
As \slab employs a chaining approach, it requires more random accesses to locate a KV pair along the chain when a high filled factor is required. Hence, \slab has inferior performance than other GPU-based solutions.}



\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Varying filled factor $\theta$.}
We vary the filled factor $\theta$ and show the performance of all GPU-based approaches against the \dsrandom dataset in Figure~\ref{fig:static-filled-factor}. The other datasets show similar trend and thus we omit the results in the paper.
\revise{For \slab, the performance of both \formal{insert} and \formal{find} is dramatically affected by the filled factor. This is because \slab employs the chaining approach, where high filled factor leads to long chains and poor performance.
Overall, \warp demonstrates superior performance for the static setting. As aforementioned, \warp has better cache locality than the other approaches. 
\voter shows competitive performance and could outperform \warp at high filled factors, e.g., $\theta \geq 0.85$. Furthermore, the linear probing strategy adopted by \warp may need to scan multiple memory positions for \formal{find} and \formal{delete}. Although \cudpp also employs the cuckoo strategy, it automatically determines the number of hash tables for a given data size. At high filled factors, \cudpp employs more hash tables and scan more buckets. Hence, its performance drops for high filled factors. In contrast, \voter and \megakv with the cuckoo strategy only inspect two buckets, which explain their stable throughput in Figure~\ref{fig:static-filled-factor} for \formal{find}. Furthermore, \voter shows better insertion performance than \megakv due to our proposed strategy for resolving conflicts efficiently. }



%\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{GPU Profiling.} To further study the behavior of the approaches, we present three types of profiling results for all \formal{insert} GPU kernels in Figure~\ref{fig:static:profile}.
%For \emph{warp efficiency}, \voter maintains a stable rate at around 70\%, which is significantly higher than the other two cuckoo hash approaches: \megakv and \cudpp.  
%We attribute this phenomenon to the voter mechanism proposed in Section~\ref{sec:vot:con}, which yields better overall load balancing. 
%\linear could achieve higher warp efficiency than \voter, but is very volatile across different datasets. This is because each \formal{insert} in \linear may require scanning varying number of hash values for distinct data distributions. 
%For example, in the \dsali dataset, its warp efficiency drops below 40\% since \dsali contains more duplicated keys than other datasets. 

%Looking at \emph{cache} and \emph{memory bandwidth} profiling results, \megakv and \voter demonstrate better utilization as they employ the bucket mechanism.
%As \voter always needs to use atomicCAS to lock a bucket before accessing it, its utilization is inferior than that of \megakv due to the additional IO when inserting a KV pair to a bucket. In addition, atomicCAS is less efficient than atomicExch as it involves more workload per operation (see Table~\ref{fig:atomic}). Nevertheless, implementations based on atomicExch only supports KV pair with 64 bits, whereas adopting atomicCAS in \voter can support arbitrary length as we lock the bucket for exclusive update.
%It is also noted that, even though \megakv has great cache utilization due to the use of atomicExch accessing buckets directly, the overall performance is eventually bounded by device memory IOs. 

%In summary, under the static environment, \voter achieves competitive efficiency against the compared GPU baselines. Moreover, although \voter does not deliver the best performance over existing approaches, it has very low insertion failure rate and supports more general hash tables.

\subsection{Dynamic Hashing Comparison}\label{sec:exp:dynamic}

\noindent\textbf{Varying insert vs. delete ratio $r$.}
In Figure~\ref{fig:vary-r-time}, we report the results for varying the ratio $r$, i.e., number of deletions over number of insertions in a batch.
We have an interesting observation that, for a larger $r$, the performance of \voter and \megakv degrades whereas that of \slab improves. As a larger $r$ indicates more deletions, resizing operations are more frequently invoked for \voter and \megakv. In contrast, more deletions leads to additional vacant spaces for \slab as it simply symbolically marks a deleted KV pair. Insertions are processed more efficiently for \slab since the inserted KV pairs can overwrite the symbolically deleted ones. Hence, \slab utilizes more GPU device memory than \voter and \megakv. However, symbolic deletions cannot guarantee a bounded filled factor and may lead to arbitrary bad memory efficiency, which will be discussed with more experimental results later in this section.
\voter shows the best overall performance. Furthermore, the throughput margin between \voter and \megakv grows for a larger $r$. 
As aforementioned, larger $r$ triggers more resizing operations, where \voter is more efficient than \megakv since \megakv employs a total rehashing approach. 

%\linear and \megakv remains inefficient as they incur expensive overheads of resizing. An interesting observation for \linear and \megakv is that there exists a sweet spot where the resizing cost is the minimal.
%It is because the workload composition of insertions and deletions should be just right so that it does not trigger unnecessary upsizings or downsizings. However, in reality, the workloads could vary significantly and existing methods cannot be easily adapted while maintaining guaranteed filled factor. This has again validated the effectiveness of \voter against dynamic workloads.


\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Performance stability.}
We evaluate the performance stability of the compared approaches in Figure~\ref{fig:track-stability}. 
In particular, we track the filled factor after processing each batch.
\slab shows good stability in terms of memory usage for the starting phases. Unfortunately, due to the symbolic deletion approach employed, the memory efficiency of \slab degrades significantly as more deletions are processed. In particular, its filled factor drops to less than $20\%$ after processing less than 100 batches for the \dsali dataset, which deems for a complete rebuild.
%
\megakv shows unstable trend since it employs a simple double/half approach for resizing. We can see its filled factor jumps up or down dramatically at the points of resizing. \voter demonstrates the best overall stability and saves up to 4x memory over the  compared baselines (the \dsali dataset). 
The results have validated our design where only one of the subtables are subject to resizing. 
Nevertheless, there is still rooms for improvement. We note that for some datasets, i.e., \dstwitter, \dsreddit, \dstpch and \dsrandom, we observe that the filled factor of \voter drops sharply.
This is because, even after one time of upsizing, the insertions fail due to too many evictions and it triggers another round of upsizing. We leave it as a future work. 


\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Varying the batch size.}
We have also varied the size of each processing batch. The results are reported in Figure~\ref{fig:vary-batch-size}. 
\slab remains to show inferior performance than \megakv and \voter. 
This is because \slab accommodates new inserted KV pairs with the chaining approach and does not increase the range of the unique hash values. Hence, a stream of insertions will eventually lead to long chains, which hurts the performance of hash table operations. Furthermore, \voter presents better performance than \megakv and the margin increases with a larger batch size.
\revise{Note that one limitation of existing GPU-based approaches is that they apply updates at the granularity of batches. It is an interesting direction for exploring efficient GPU hashing when a required update order is enforced.}


\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Varying the filled factor lower bound $\alpha$.}
We vary the lower bound of the filled factor and report the results in Figure~\ref{fig:vary-lower-time}. 
We only compare \megakv and \voter since \slab is unable to control the filled factor because of \slab's symbolic deletion approach. 
Apparently, the simple resizing strategy adopted by \megakv incurs substantial overhead. Such overhead grows for a higher $\alpha$ since the number of downsizings increases. The performance of \voter is not affected significantly due to the incremental resizing approach by updating only one subtable at a time. 
%We note that, the performance of \megakv is competitive against \voter for the \dsali dataset. This is because \megakv occupies significant more memory spaces than that of \voter, as evidenced in Figure~\ref{fig:track-stability}. Hence, \megakv trades space efficiency with time efficiency.
%Nevertheless, \voter remains superior over \megakv in terms of time efficiency while saves GPU memory substantially. 



\vspace{1mm}\noindent\textbf{Varying the filled factor upper bound $\beta$.}
The results for varying $\beta$ is reported in Figure~\ref{fig:vary-upper-time}. 
It is interesting to see that the upper bound does not significantly affect the overall performance for \megakv and \voter. 
On one hand, higher filled factor leads to slower \formal{insert} performance. On the other hand, less number of rehashing incurred for a higher filled factor. Thus, the overall performance remains stable for both approaches as the opposing factors cancel each other. Nevertheless, \voter remains superior over \megakv in terms of time efficiency while saves GPU memory substantially.

%\megakv has competitive efficiency against \voter in the \dsali dataset. %The reason is similar as we discussed for varying the lower bound $\alpha$.
