\begin{abstract}
Hash table, one of the most fundamental data structures,
have been implemented on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate a wide range of data analytics workloads. Most existing works focus on the static scenario and try to occupy large GPU memory for maximizing the insertion efficiency. In many cases, the data stored in the hash table gets updated dynamically and existing approaches take unnecessarily large memory resources.
One na\"ive solution is to rebuild a hash table (a.k.a rehashing) whenever it is either filled or mostly empty. However, this approach renders significant overheads for rehashing.
In this paper, we propose \emph{DyCuckoo}, a novel dynamic cuckoo hash table on GPUs. 
We devise an efficient resizing strategy for the dynamic scenario without rehashing the entire table and the strategy ensures a guaranteed filled factor.
The strategy trades search performance with resizing efficiency and the tradeoff can be configured by the users.
To further improve efficiency, we further propose a two-layer cuckoo hashing scheme that ensures at most \emph{two} lookups for find and delete operations, while still retains similar performance for insertion as that of general cuckoo hash tables. 
Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of the proposed design over several state-of-the-art hash table implementations on GPUs. 
\emph{DyCuckoo} achieves superior performance while saves up to 4x memory over the state-of-the-art approaches against dynamic workloads.
